<h2>Family</h2>
<p>I come from a small family. My mom, dad, and brother. I love my family because they’re not just my family, but friends as well. A big part of my family comes from serving in the military too. The Marine Corps and the Army. Most of my relatives are from Mexico.

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>On my freetime I like to draw or play sports. I also like going to the park and having fun with my family. Or just playing with my brother.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I like to draw and I would say that I’m still a beginner but can draw a little good. I also like sports like soccer, football, dodgeball, archery, and a little bit of track.

<p>I am really interested in exploring. I like to walk into the wilderness or hike. I’m also interested in vehicles. I like helping fix them.
